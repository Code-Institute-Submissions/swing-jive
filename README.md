# Music Project

### Project 1 with Code Institute 
#### Rebecca Manning

Starting my first project having begun the course with no computer science background or coding knowledge, this was one of my biggest challenges!

----------------
### SWING/JIVE
#### What the project does, needs it fulfills & functionality

I created a website for a Swing/Jive band located in Dublin that mainly focus on playing at Wedding or Corporate events but also play various concerts. 

----------------
### TECHNOLOGIES

* Bootstrap
* FlexBox
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Angular JS

----------------
### DEPLOYMENT

**Github** - https://bmanning1.github.io/swing-jive

----------------
### TESTING

* https://validator.w3.org/
* I frequenty asked friends, family and peers to have a look trhough my website and give feedback on code, functionality or aesthetics that could be improved. My mum is very much into Swing and Jive dancing so she was a great help and even appears in one of the pictures on the home page!
* I constantly tested the website on different browsers as well as different size screens.

----------------
### CREDIT

* Itunes API
* Carousel
* Textillate 
* Some of my Code I got from Code Institute as it is the course I am taking - I have showed in my annotation that I understand it all and also personalised it a lot to my needs.
* Images were sourced from Pixabay (a free royalty-free images site) or created myself.

----------------
### CHALLENGES
#### What was kept/changed to fit my need

Home page grabbing attention
landscape design - struggled with the mobile portrait conversion
as first project struggled getting the hang of lots of parts so extra revision was needed! Probably made it more complicated than needed
Interactive: breathing buttons and the listen page. fun to explore for the user.
Home page struggle with the animation
mixing the corporate with weddings theme and fun swing jive

### PROJECT BRIEF
#### Code Institute

**Create A Website For A Band**

* Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson. You can use either your own assets or the assets in the following GitHub repo (https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/project-assets).

* The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:

* Their primary target audience are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalogue, and any new material as it becomes available.

* In addition, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

* The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
  * Photos of the band members
  * A video clip
  * Audio clips

* The band would also like to publicise upcoming gigs in the future. They would like users to be able to contact them with potential work related leads. The site should contain the ability to check on the band’s availability for future bookings and costs associated with various types of booking. To do this the band would like you to create a contact form which will take all of the details, such as, name, email, date, event type. Based on this data, the site will inform the user whether or not the date is available and the cost estimate for the event. All of this should be done using client-side JavaScript (no backend.)

* In addition, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

**Create Your Own Project (Recommended)**

* If you choose to create your own project, the scope should be similar to that of the example brief above. If you want some ideas, please ask your mentor for advice and direction.

-----------------
### PROJECT GUIDELINES
#### Code Institute

* Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas

* Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this)

* Include at least one form with validation. Since you are not expected to build a backend for the project, all this form needs to do is inform the user of whether or not the data was submitted successfully (i.e. passed validation)

* Use semantic HTML5 markup.

* Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers.

* The site should contain your own custom JavaScript logic – include at least one interactive component on your site that is based on non-trivial javascript logic. You can write this logic either inside an Angular controller/service, or in a separate js file.

* You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of you websites functionality works well. Automated testing using frameworks such as Jasmine are preferable, but properly documented manual tests are also acceptable.

* Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based off other code, explain what was kept and/or how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.

* Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.

* Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

### FINAL NOTES

I would just like to mention that the reason the github uploads are not spread out more evenly is because I've also been in my final year at Universtiy so have been working on this course when I haven't had exams or coursework.
